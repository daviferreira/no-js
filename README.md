no-js
=====

no-js aims to be a set of components for web apps and sites (such as
modals, lightbox, tabs and menus) written purely using CSS, with no JavaScript.

It's still on a very early development stage and any extra help would
be really great :)

## Done

* simple lightbox
* lightbox pagination

## In progress

* tabs

## TODO

* custom/regular style
* lightbox transition
* menu
* carousel
* accordion
* buttons
* animations
* mosaic
* tooltip
* notification badge
* notifications

## Development

```npm install``` + ```gulp watch```
